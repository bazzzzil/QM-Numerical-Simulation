Numerical Methods for Problems in Physics (Quantum Mechanics, mostly)

This a repository containing detailed examples for numerical methods commonly applied in quantum mechanics problems. Specifically, RK4 method for calculating integrals, followed by the Crank-Nicolson method for solving parabolic partial differential equations and finally the split operator method (general and FFT).
